# GraphTraversalDFS
This is a project from my csc 241 class.  The teacher had given you a graph and you job was to trace the code using DFS(Depth First Search) Algorithm.  In order to create the graph I allow the user to enter the nodes and their connections.  From their I was supposed to use the DFS algorithm to traverse through the array and detect if a cylce existed or not.
